This  explains how to create a MySQL database and registration table using PhpMyAdmin, a free tool for managing MySQL databases. To follow along, you will need to have XAMPP installed on your Windows machine. XAMPP is a free web server solution stack that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl.

To start, launch the XAMPP Control Panel by double-clicking on the xampp-control.exe file in the installation location. Start Apache and MySQL by clicking on the Start button next to their names in the Control Panel. Then, open PhpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your web browser.

Next, create a new database by clicking on the New button and entering a name for your database in the Database name field. Select utf8_general_ci as the collation and leave the other settings as they are. Click on the Create button to create your new database.

Once your database is created, select it in the left-hand sidebar and click on the New button to create a new table. Name your table "registration" and set the number of columns to 7. Define the columns of your table in the Structure tab using the details provided in the guide. Click on the Save button to save your table.

To add data to your table, open the register.html file at http://localhost/folder_name/register.html. Finally, you can review your project by comparing your registration table to the image provided in this project.
